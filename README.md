# Palette.py

I made this small script to automatically generate, given an image, a new one containing it and his palette. I initially did it with movies in mind but it can be clearly used for whatever.

### Prerequisites

To use this script you'll need the library [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) and [colorgram.py](https://github.com/obskyr/colorgram.py).

They can be installed by using:

```
pip3 install Pillow
pip3 install cologram.py
```

### Installing

Quite simple, you can download the palette.py file or clone the whole repo (a lil' overkill)

## How to use it

Quite simple again:

```
python3 Palette.py path/to/image/i/want/to/extract/palette.ext
```

## Built With

* [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow)
* [colorgram.py](https://github.com/obskyr/colorgram.py)
